            I gained hands-on development experience during my internship at a
            Salesken, where I worked closely with senior developers to
            expand my skills beyond the MERN stack, mastering jQuery and
            Metronic Bootstrap. This role introduced me to professional
            development practices and allowed me to make meaningful
            contributions.
